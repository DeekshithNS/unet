    1.OVERVIEW
            This project helps you to understand rate error models,basically the main
            idea is to calculate the rate error when a bit is sent from one node to other node.
            This simulation is done on unetstack, a brief idea on unetstack is documented and this
            available at unetstacks official website.
    
    
    2.Install Unetstack
            Goto downloads in unetstack official website, download and install the unetsatck 1.3.
            
    3.Clone the project
            Clone the project to a folder.
            
    4.Run the simulation
            Run the code on unetIDE.
